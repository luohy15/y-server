## ⚙️ Configuration

### ☁️ Cloudflare Worker Configuration
The project uses `wrangler.toml` for Cloudflare Worker configuration:

```toml
name = "y-server"
main = "src/index.ts"
compatibility_flags = [ "nodejs_compat" ]
compatibility_date = "2024-09-23"

[[r2_buckets]]
binding = "CDN_BUCKET"
bucket_name = "cdn-yovy-app"

[dev]
port = 8788
ip = "localhost"
local_protocol = "http"
```

### 🔐 Required Environment Variables
- `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`: Your Cloudflare account ID

```bash
npm run build
```

### 🚀 Deploy
Deploy to Cloudflare Workers:
```bash
npm run deploy
```

## 🔌 MCP Integration

This server implements the Model Context Protocol, allowing AI assistants to use the provided tools through a standardized interface. It uses a streamable HTTP transport that enables efficient communication with AI models.

### 🧩 Integration with y-gui

y-server is designed to work as an MCP server for [y-gui](https://github.com/luohy15/y-gui), a web-based graphical interface for AI chat interactions. The y-gui client provides:

- 💬 Interactive chat interface with AI models
- 🤖 Support for multiple bot configurations
- 🔗 Comprehensive MCP integration system
- 🔒 Secure authentication with Auth0 and Google login
- 🌓 Dark/light theme support
- 📝 All chat data stored in Cloudflare R2

To connect y-server with y-gui:

1. Deploy your y-server instance
2. In y-gui, configure a new MCP server with your y-server URL
3. Enable the desired tools in your bot configuration

For more information, visit the [y-gui repository](https://github.com/luohy15/y-gui).

There's also a CLI version available: [y-cli](https://github.com/luohy15/y-cli).
